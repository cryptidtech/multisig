A Rust implementation of the [multiformats][2] [multisig specification][3].

## Current Status 

It currently supports the following digital signature protocols.

* EdDSA (ed25519)
* Es256K (secp256k1)
* BLS12-381 G1/G2

The BLS curve implementation also supports threshold signatures.

This crate also supports converting to/from SSH format digital signatures using
the [`ssh-key`][4] crate. This gives full OpenSSH compatibility for reading in
OpenSSH serialized signatures and converting them to Multisig format. This even
includes non-standard SSH key protocols such as Es256K and BBLS12-381 G1/G2
signatures through the use of [RFC 4251][5] standard for "additional
algorithms" names using the "@multisig" domain suffix. For instance, using this
crate, an Es256K Multisig converted to an SSH format signature has the
algorithm name "secp256k1@multisig". A BLS12-381 G1 signature share converted
to SSH format has the algorithm name "bls12_381-g1-share@multsig".

## Introduction

This is a Rust implementation of a multicodec format for digital signatures.
The design of the format is intentionally abstract to support any kind of
digital signature data for any protocol. This format should best be thought of
as a container of signature data with abstract, protocol-specific views with a
generic and self-describing data storage format. 

Every piece of data in a serialized Multisig object either has a known-fixed
size or a self-describing variable size such that software processing these
objects do not need to support all digital signature protocols to be able to
accurately calculate the size of the serialized object and skip over it if
needed.

The only operations that can be executed on a Multisig object are those that
return the attribute data and the threshold signature operations for
accumulating and combining signature shares. Any operation that involves a
cryptographic key (e.g. signing, verifying) is found in the [`Multikey`][6]
companion crate.

## Views on the Multisig Data

To provide an abstract interface to digital signatures of all schemes and 
formats, this Multisig crate provides "views" on the Multisig data. These are 
read-only abstract interfaces to the Multisig that have implementations for 
the different supporting signature protocols.

Currently the set of views provide generic access to the "payload encoding"
codec (`multisig::AttrView`), the signature data (`multisig::SigDataView`), 
the threshold signing attributes if the protocol supports it 
(`multisig::ThresholdAttrView`) and the interface for doing threshold signature 
operations such as accessing and adding shares as well as combining shares 
(`multisig::ThresholdView`).

It is important to note that the functions in the various views that seem to
mutate the Multisig in fact do a copy-on-write (CoW) operation and return a new
Multisig with the mutation applied. This is most important when trying to
reconstruct a threshold signature from its shares. The best example of this is
in the `multisig::Builder::try_build()` method. You'll see that it loops over
the shares adding each one and replacing it's mutable multisig variable with
the new one containing the updated shares.

```
let mut multisig = Multisig { .. };
for share in &shares {
    multisig = {
        let tv = multisig.threshold_view()?;
        // this is a CoW operation returning a mutated Multisig
        tv.add_share(share)?
    };
}
```

### What about Varsig?

There already exists a multicodec signature format called Varsig but it has
some serious deficiencies in design. Here is the Varsig ["spec"][7]. The
greatest failing of Varsig is that it fails to meet [the requirements][8] for
all Multicodec data types:

* They MUST be in-band (with the value); not out-of-band (in context).
* They MUST avoid lock-in and promote extensibility.
* They MUST be compact and have a binary-packed representation.
* They MUST have a human-readable representation.

The design of Varsig relies on out-of-band context to make sense of the 
signature-specific values (see below).

This new Multisig implementation uses a new multicodec sigil `0x39` instead of 
the Varsig `0x34` to distinguish the two formats. 

The good news is that converting from Varsig to Multisig should be straight 
forward if you already have code to understand a specific Varsig format. Just
pull the relevant bits of data out of the Varsig and then use the 
`multisig::Builder` to construct a Multisig from the relevant parts.

Here's is the Varsig format as I understand it from the specification.

#### Varsig Format (may differ from the spec by the time you read this)

```
                         payload encoding
     key codec                codec
         |                      |
         v                      v
0x34 <varuint> N(<varuint>) <varuint> N(OCTET)
^                    ^                    ^
|                    |                    |
varsig      variable number of     variable number
sigil       signature specific    of signature data
                   values              octets
```

The Varsig format unfortunately has a variable number of signature-specific 
values immediately following the key codec and before the encoding codec. This
makes it impossible for a tool to decode the encoding codec when it doesn't
recognize the key codec. Since there are no counts or lengths encoded in the 
Varsig data, it is impossible to know the full length of any Varsig without
having complete support for every key codec. Multisig format seeks to fix that
by adding counts for the variable number of varuints and a length to the
variable number of octets (i.e. [`Varbytes`][9]).
